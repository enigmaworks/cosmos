# The Cosmos

## a space exploration & survival game

### about

This is just a low effort hobby project... the demo can be found [here](https://thecosmos.ga/)

If you want to run it locally, you'll need to run some sort of local server to serve the files (the modules won't work otherwise). I use VsCode and the Live Server Extension for development.

### Controls

left - right arrows to rotate
up arrrow to fire engine
space to activate booster engine

### history

It started off with me just messing around with 360deg movement and controls. I got bored with that after a while, and was like, hey, what if I add planets and gravity?

Then I just kept tweaking little things here and there, got bored, quit for a while becuase nothing worked, made this repo and completely rewrote the code from the old one and now here I am.
